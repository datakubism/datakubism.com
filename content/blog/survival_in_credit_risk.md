title: Application of Survival Analysis in Credit Risk Modeling
---

# The Problem:

The client wanted to explore new ways of modelling credit default risk of existing customers by employing all available historic data and taking into account the inherent time aspect of the problem.

# Our Approach:

dataKubism’s team explored the adoption of duration analysis models in the workflow of the customer. Real customer data from several commercial banks was used. The model combined deep learning with traditional statistics to give a more detailed view of the customers probability of default over time.

# Deliverables:

dataKubism’s team prepared a white paper detailing the results of the project, comparing our approach to existing methodology. In addition SAS and R libraries were created for future implementation of the methodology into the customer’s workflow
