# The Problem:

The client wanted to know what their customers were most happy of and respectively what they disliked the most. Usually such feedback comes in the form of open-ended questions in their CRM system. Therefore, in order to understand customers best, text analysis was needed.

# Our Approach:

All open-ended questions were classified into topics. For each of the topics, sentiment was calculated. Afterwards, most negative and most positive topics were identified, as well as most reoccurring ones. This information was linked to different financial KPIs and effect of the topics was examined through time.

# Deliverables:

In order not to spill effects from one store to the others, analysis was implemented on store level. Top 3 most negative and Top 3 most positive topics were identified for each store, and actions were recommended to store managers in order to address the issues.
