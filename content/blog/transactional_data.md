title: Customer Segmentation Based on Transactional Data
---

# The Problem:

The client wanted to deep dive into their transactional data, and identify cross-sell opportunities. Affordability index was to be estimated based on the current account data, and possible further uses of this data across a number of operational areas was to be examined.

# Our Approach:

All transactions were classified on account level, thus, we were able to calculate disposable income per account. In addition, High Risk Triggers were identified within transaction history. Different clustering techniques were implemented in order to be able to identify different segments of customers from current account data. 

# Deliverables:

Having identified disposable income per account, customer segmentation was implemented which was used for better targeting of upsell and cross-sell opportunities, and risk-profiling of customers which was later used to assist in the credit decision making process of the client.
